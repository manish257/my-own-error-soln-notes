Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached, watch ...some file name


My SOLUTION:

If you want to get error once you are trying to execute npm start, itâ€™s because of your `max_user_watches` was reached the maximum number. Simply you can increase the `max_user_watches` by running this command :

echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

sudo sysctl -p

npm start
