The error "You are importing createRoot from 'react-dom' which is not supported" occurs when we import the createRoot function from react-dom. To solve the error, import createRoot from react-dom/client, e.g. import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client'.



Solution:

import {createRoot} from 'react-dom'; // üëàÔ∏è wrong import path

// ‚úÖ now importing from react-dom/client
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client';
