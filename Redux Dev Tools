go to the root index file,

import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';

then before declaring store,

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

const store = createStore(reducers,composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware()));

// will use applyMiddleware(thunk) 
// after using middleware

// setup complete now you should be able to see the store and states in redux dev tools


Another use,

Debug sessions with redux dev tools

when you go to,

localhost:3000?debug_session=<some_string>

eg.

localhost:3000?debug_session=ndwoiwcxow

after this, redux dev tools makes sure that the data stays around between the refreshes of the page.

we can also name these sessions and come back to them later
