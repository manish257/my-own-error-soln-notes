check if docker is installed with

docker --version

install using,
sudo apt install docker.io

docker --version

sudo systemctl status docker

check if docker works by using command,

sudo docker run hello-world

dont forget to use sudo to use docker if you are on linux

to see docker images available,
sudo docker images

to see running and available docker apps, ps = process status
sudo docker ps
sudo docker container ls

to see hidden processes,
sudo docker ps -a

to see all docker images,
sudo docker image ls

use postgres image with docker-compose,
first install docker-compose
sudo apt install docker-compose

make a yml file for docker compose with name docker-compose.yml

should include texts like:

# Use postgres/example user/password credentials
version: '3.1'

services:

  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example

  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

code ref:
https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres

now you can run this yml file to run docker image using command,
sudo docker-compose up

or

sudo docker-compose up -d


now check you system postgres by using,
psql -U postgres -h localhost


if you want to pull any docker image:
sudo docker pull mongo

now you can run mongo using,

sudo docker run -d -p 2701:2701 mongo


after running docker ps we can run a command in a running container using:

sudo docker exec -it nameofcontainer
where it is the command we used

we have to stop container when using done:

sudo docker container stop nameofcontainer

we can remove container using:
sudo docker rm nameofcontainer


======

if you already got the database and docker-composite file, just cd into that folder and use:
sudo docker-compose up
